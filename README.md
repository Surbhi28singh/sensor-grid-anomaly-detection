## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to **detect and debug faults in IoT sensor grids** using **Machine Learning**.  
A **5x5 sensor grid (25 nodes)** is simulated with synthetic readings, where random spikes and drops are injected to mimic faulty behavior.  
The **Isolation Forest algorithm** is applied to detect anomalies automatically, without the need for labeled data.  

The results are visualized using **time-series plots** and a **heatmap**, making it easy to identify malfunctioning nodes.  
This project demonstrates how ML can improve reliability in **IoT, smart grids, and industrial systems**.
